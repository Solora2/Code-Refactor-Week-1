# Code-Refactor-Week-1
This assignmnet is meant to make the code more accesible. It is also meant to clean up the code and make it easier for the next person to read.
This being my first project and having no experince with coding whatsoever made this more challenging for me than the average student in this class. Having said that I trust, that when I am done this couse I will look back and feel proud of how much I've leared and progressed over time. 

The main code is staying the same. We are just making it clearer. I have added descriptions to images in case they do not load for any reason. (by using the alt tag)
I have also cleaned up the code a little bit to make it easier for the next person to read. 
changed the title more descriptive to the actual page rather than just "Website"
